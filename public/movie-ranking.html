 <h2>My top 3 Anime Movies of all-time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Spirited Away (2001) – Studio Ghibli / Hayao Miyazaki</h3>
 <p>
    It's a magical coming-of-age story filled with surreal characters and lush world-<br />
    building. The animation is timeless, and the themes of identity, resilience, and environmentalism hit hard<br />
    even today.<br />
</p>
 <h3>Your Name (2016) – Makoto Shinkai</h3>
 <p>
    A beautiful fusion of romance, time travel, and destiny. The emotional pacing, music<br />
    (RADWIMPS!), and visuals create a gut-punch of a movie. It hits especially hard if you’ve ever missed<br />
    someone you never quite got to know.<br />
</p>
 <h3>Perfect Blue (1997) – Satoshi Kon</h3>
 <p>
    This psychological thriller blurs the line between reality and illusion. It’s intense,<br />
    disturbing, and thought-provoking—a deep dive into identity, fame, and mental breakdown.<br />
